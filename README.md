# Design Thinking Use-Case for PizzaPlanet
CPRE 288 PizzaPlanet Application Story

# Introduction

**Design Context:**  Our design is for a fast semi-autonomous vehicle that delivers a warm product to the customer in punctual manner.  Our vehicle is able to detect potholes, and drive between the lines in the road to safely deliver our product.  In addition, it is also able to signify it has reached its final destination by playing music so that the customer can come out to grab the product.

**Users and Stakeholders:** Our design takes into consideration our two most important stakeholders.  First is our business owner Bob Jenkins. Bob wants to get as much money as possible for his shipping company. He is on board with automation, but only if it can reduce costs with little overhead. He isn't willing to wait very long before seeing an increase in profits. He also isn’t very technologically inclined, so he wants the interface to all be easy to use so he can make changes and track deliveries as they are on route. He is concerned that customers will not think the automated delivery system is as safe as having humans make the deliveries, so he needs assurance everything will work perfectly.  Our second stakeholder is our consume Jackie Chan.  Jackie is an Iowa state college student in his twenties.  His parents are rich businessmen, but don’t give him money so he has to earn every dollar he makes.  He strongly values his time and money so fast and affordable delivery is what he wants out of his favorite delivery place.  

# Design Process

**Defining a Design Problem:**  To define the problem, it was critical to identify the primary needs, emotions, and motivations of our stakeholders so that we could tailor our solutions appropriately.  In this step we identified several specific problems.  We identified Bob’s need for a way to easily track deliveries, additionally his  need for assurance that deliveries would be safe, and Jackie’s  need for fast pizza delivery.  In relationship to our prototype, our problem involved finding a way to map out our delivery path to safely avoid other vehicles or humans, as well as finding a way to get to our parking space quickly.

**Empathizing:**  Taking into account our two persons, we realized it would be important to have both a web application that would be able to track our delivers, as well as a plan for rapid delivery pizza delivery.  In addition, we needed to make sure that Bob’s safety concerns were met and that the vehicle would be able to deliver the product safely

 

# Outcomes

**Insights from Users:** Our insights helped guide our design.  The most important problems to be solved involved making sure that our primary stakeholders were satisfied.   We identified that we would need to both account for both Bob’s need for safe delivery, and vehicle tracking as well as Jackie’s need for fast delivery.  Identifying these needs helped form a foundation for which to solve our problem.  

**Testing and Prototyping:** To implement this in our project design, we needed our car to travel as straight as possible so that we could track the distance the car moved on a cartesian coordinate system to emulate a GPS navigational system system.  This required a lot of testing to finding the perfect speed to account for the difference in wheel sizes so that our vehicle would accurately turn and move forward.  Also to account for Bob’s safety concerns we needed to make sure that all of our sensors were well calibrated.  This involved re-calibrating our IR sensor, and thorough testing of our sensors to make sure that we could distinguish between our parking space, and objects that we would need to avoid. 

# Conclusion

**Evaluation of Outcomes:**  Our solution was appropriate to accommodate our primary stakeholders.  We identified addressed the 3 most critical needs of our stakeholders, and tailored our design solution to accommodate these needs.  Given that our ideation process occurred over the course of 10 weeks and we all spent an average of 45 minutes a week on this, I would say that our ideation process was proficiently thorough and lead to a successful outcome and accomplishment of our primary objectives.

**Changes in Future:**  If we continued to work on this in the future we would make our vehicle fully autonomous, but given the time restrictions and our current skillsets we managed to leverage our strengths to achieve an equally impressive product.
